Content for SavageRebirth.com
=================

Content here is used on SavageRebirth.com in places like the game guide.

A file name should be the same as the URL for that file but with `:` instead of `/` with the .md extension. For example `guide:get-started:what-is-savage.md`. 
Some areas will have a sidebar with link trees generated from these files. The previous example would have a sidebar in any place under the `guide` route with a heading `Get Started` creatd from the file name and under it link to the file `What is Savage?`, this would be created from the h1 of the page. 

For images to use within a page go to http://savagerebirth.com/content-images and choose one or with your pull request ask for an image to be added.
